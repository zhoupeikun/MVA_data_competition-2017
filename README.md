## Email recipient recommendation

It was shown that at work, employees frequently forget to include one or more recipient(s) before sending a message. Conversely, it is common that some recipients of a given message were actually not intended to receive the message. To increase productivity and prevent information leakage, the needs for effective email recipient recommendation systems are thus pressing.

In this challenge, you are asked to develop such a system, which, given the content and the date of a message, recommends a list of 10 recipients ranked by decreasing order of relevance.
